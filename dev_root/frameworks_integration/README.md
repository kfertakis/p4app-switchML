In order to use **SwitchML** with one of the popular DNN frameworks such as Tensorflow or PyTorch, you need to use one of the integration methods.
  
| Integration method | Supported Frameworks | Status |
|--|--|--|
| [NCCL Plugin](/dev_root/frameworks_integration/nccl_plugin) | Tensorflow through Horovod, PyTorch | Needs more testing |
| [Pytorch Patch](/dev_root/frameworks_integration/pytorch_patch) | Pytorch | Stable |
| [Pytorch Plugin](/dev_root/frameworks_integration/pytorch_plugin) | Pytorch | Needs more testing |

Read more about each method by checking its corresponding documentation.
